ðŸš€ A simple proof-of-concept showing how **fraud detection + transparency** can improve Gleam campaigns. Designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time with transparency, accuracy, and scalability. 

## Highlights
  - End-to-End Pipeline: Data generation â†’ Model training â†’ Real-time fraud detection.
  - Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression classifier with confidence scores.
  - Interactive Dashboard: Real-time display of fraud predictions and analytics.
  - Secure & Transparent: Traceable predictions and clear logging.

ðŸ›  Full-Stack Expertise: Demonstrates backend, ML, and frontend integration skills.

## Features
- Detects:
  - Duplicate emails
  - Disposable email domains
  - Proxy/VPN connections (via IP check API)
  - Bot-like behavior (too many actions/minute)
- Provides **clear flags** instead of silent shadowbans.
- Includes a simple Flask app to demo results.

## Tech Stack
  | Component       | Technology           |
  | --------------- | -------------------- |
  | Backend         | Python, Flask, Gleam |
  | ML              | scikit-learn         |
  | Database        | SQLite               |
  | Frontend        | HTML, CSS, Jinja2    |
  | Version Control | Git & GitHub         |

## How It Works
  - Data Simulation â€“ Generates synthetic user transactions.
  - Model Training â€“ Logistic regression model classifies transactions.
  - Prediction â€“ Outputs confidence scores for each transaction.
  - Visualization â€“ Interactive dashboard for monitoring flagged transactions.
